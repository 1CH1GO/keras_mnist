## Introduction

This repo consists of codes which are useful in predicting the handwritten digits. The dataset used is from the keras MNIST dataset. Although this is the "Hello world" of deep learning, this model achieves an accuracy of about 98% which is pretty cool for a basic model. There are many ways to improve this model which would be done in the future.

I added the convolution network code which acheives 99% accuracy. Awesome!!.

Added **GUI**. Thanks and credit goes to the author of [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/handwritten-digit-recognition-gui-app-46e3d7b37287) article.

## Usage on Local Machine
* The first thing you need to do is to clone this repository by typing the following command :-

`git clone https://github.com/1CH1GO/keras_mnist.git`

* Then you need to change the directory to `keras_mnist`.

* Before executing the code you need to install some packages. You can use a virtual environment or install globally. Virtual environment is the preferred one.

* The packages can be installed by the following command :-

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

* After that you can execute the file `image_prediction.py` using the follwing command :-

`python3 image_prediction.py`
